  Partnership.

=== 4 / 2012-04-04

* API changes:
  * Growl is now a wrapper for Growl::UDP (1.2 and older) and Growl::GNTP (1.3
    and newer).  The main difference is that notifications need to be
    registered with Growl#add_notification instead of via Growl#initialize.
  * Ruby 1.9.2 or newer is required to use ruby-growl

* Major enhancements
  * Added GNTP protocol support for registration and notification including
    application and notification icons and callbacks.
  * Moved UDP protocol support to Growl::UDP
  * Growl automatically determines if the growl server supports GNTP or UDP
    and uses the best protocol.
